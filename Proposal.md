# Proposal For the [Habit Reminder](https://github.com/NaveenTanuku/HabitReminder)
## Introduction
The goal of our web application is to display a student's habit based on the weekday. When the user clicks on a habit, it displays several photos and text descriptions, as well as a checkbox to see if the habit was completed today or not. We can reward the account with points or credits if the user completes the habit for the day.

• The budget is determined by the size of the development team and the average estimated weekly hours per developer.</br>
• The scope of work should be clearly split into time sprints.</br>
