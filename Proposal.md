# Proposal For the [Habit Reminder](https://github.com/NaveenTanuku/HabitReminder)
## Introduction
The goal of our web application is to display a student's habit based on the weekday. When the user clicks on a habit, it displays several photos and text descriptions, as well as a checkbox to see if the habit was completed today or not. We can reward the account with points or credits if the user completes the habit for the day.

## Schedule & sprints 
• GDP semesters determine the schedule and sprints (approximately every two weeks Equals a sprint).</br>

### Sprint 1  
#### Gather Requirements 
We need to figure out exactly what you require and what you believe in. Only then can we start designing a design that reflects the value you provide in a way that resonates with the people who matter: your app's users.

### Sprint 2 
####  Design Presentation
• Using Front-end page plan (single-page web app (SPA) and Front-end responsive design, a new design concept will be presented based on your sketches (Bootstrap). There will undoubtedly be a common subject, but we will strive to think outside the box and come up with something unique. The best ideas are frequently generated in this manner.



## Technological stack
‣ Backend language + framework (Java / Spring (or Spring Boot)</br>
‣ Backend app host (Heroku) </br>
‣ Data host + type (Atlas MongoDB) </br>
‣ Front-end page plan (single-page web app (SPA) </br>
‣ Front-end responsive design (Bootstrap) </br>
‣ Static analysis tools (Codacy) </br>

Draft 
• The budget is determined by the size of the development team and the average estimated weekly hours per developer.</br>
• The scope of work should be clearly split into time sprints.</br>
